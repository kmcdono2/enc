### What's happening here?

This site shares work-in-progress on space and place in Diderot and d'Alembert's [Encyclopédie](https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/encyclopedie1117/). We are a research collective experimenting on geographic information retrieval in reference texts from early modern France. We are one historian, one computer scientist, and one computational linguist.

Our work at the moment focuses on using new methods in Named Entity Recognition (NER) to interpret the spatial horizons of the *Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, par une Société de Gens de lettres* (First Paris edition 1751-1772, in 17 volumes of text and 11 volumes of plates). There are 44,632 total text entries and 14,445 entries classified by the original editors as *Géographie*.

We use a customized version of [PERDIDO](http://erig.univ-pau.fr/PERDIDO/=) to answer questions like:
- What are the "black holes" of geographic information in early modern reference works?
- How do authors structure the delivery of geographic information?
- What are the relationships between spatial information, people, ideas, and other entities (such as events, objects, or institutions)?
- How are rural spaces represented?
- How could we re-categorize geography subject articles based on their content (e.g. biographical) rather than their temporal or political status (modern, ancient, ecclesiastical, etc.)?

### Early Modern Geographical Information

thoughts...

> "Questions of spatiality – the geography of and in things, be they places,
peoples, books, ideas or representational procedures such as writing and
mapping – are, like questions of temporality and embodiment, ontological
fixtures.What may matter more in understanding questions of geography in
relation to the eighteenth century is the form taken by geography the subject
– geography as the practices by which the world was encountered and
inscribed in word and image and made real to its audiences (and the
relationships between these themes and the explanation of them). We can
then also address the interpretative significance that comes with thinking
geographically about intellectual history and the lived experience of the
eighteenth century."[^1]
