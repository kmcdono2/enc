### Enlightenment Geographical Information

<i class="fas fa-book-open fa-3x fa-pull-left"></i> This site shares work-in-progress on space and place in Diderot and d'Alembert's [Encyclopédie](https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/encyclopedie1117/).


> "Questions of spatiality – the geography of and in things, be they places,
peoples, books, ideas or representational procedures such as writing and
mapping – are, like questions of temporality and embodiment, ontological
fixtures.What may matter more in understanding questions of geography in
relation to the eighteenth century is the form taken by geography the subject
– geography as the practices by which the world was encountered and
inscribed in word and image and made real to its audiences (and the
relationships between these themes and the explanation of them). We can
then also address the interpretative significance that comes with thinking
geographically about intellectual history and the lived experience of the
eighteenth century."[^1]
